My name is John and my pronouns are they/them. I am a person living in Lancashire, England.

The purpose of my work is to create a world where all things work together voluntarily for mutual benefit. As such, my work is rooted in _posthumanism_, _cooperation_, _consensus_, and _reciprocity_.

_Posthumanism_ is

something about extending personhood beyond humans?
at least, distinction between human and person and need to incorporate groups, systems, and sentient and non-sentient non-humans

_Cooperation_ means "to work together". I am interested in how individuals, groups, and systems do things together.

_Consensus_ means "to agree together". It comes from the Latin _consentire_, which literally means "to feel together". It is also the origin of _consent_, which means "to give permission, to allow something to happen". _Consent_ is the the basis for liberty and freedom in our relationships: we only do things to other people when we have their permission to do so. _Consensus_ builds on consent, and emphasises discussion: by talking with other people, we can understand each other's needs, we can find shared goals, and we can coordinate our actions. _Consentire_ deepens consensus, by bringing in emotions and experiences as other things that we must share.




_Reciprocity_ means "to move backward and forward".

Not sure about this. I originally wrote _mutuality_. Is there something else I am getting at here rather than bidirectional flows?

work is rooted in posthumanism, cooperation, consent, and mutuality
these are some of the things I refer to when I describe myself as an anarchist












agents
working together
voluntarily
for mutual benefit










work is rooted in consensus, solidarity, and cooperation
_consensus_ comes from Latin _consentire_, which means "to feel together"
















consent is not enough, people readily consent to authority all the time. is that true consent? yes, sometimes people like having a 'leader', it raises questions around social conditioning vs autonomy which are quite hairy.

what else is needed to stop people from consenting to authority?

consent | consensus | sympathy
mutual | together | reciprocal | solidarity
cooperation






authority can be coercion or imposition
both are bad because they force circumstances onto agents without their consent
consent, collaboration, ... doing together? being together?


anarchism is:
anti-authority
self-organisation
critical of power
equality / equity
consensual
consensus
anti-property / commons
voluntary
social
community
thriving / joy
relational
liberty
freedom
autonomy
solidarity
direct action
praxis
free association
mutual aid
democracy
participation











work is rooted in a rejection of authority [what is authority?]






work is rooted in anarchism
a philosophy which is critical of hierarchy [no, it's so much more than this, this is not the root...]





art, research, software engineering [this doesn't feel right...]
