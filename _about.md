My name is John and my pronouns are they/them. I am a person living in Lancashire, England.

The purpose of my work is to create a world where all things can work together voluntarily for mutual benefit. As such, my work is rooted in *machines*, *consent*, and *cooperation*.

***Machines*** are things which can take part in *processes*. ...

***People***

***Consent*** means "to give permission, to allow something to happen". Our freedom as people depends on the presence of *consent* in their relationships. We are free when we are free from coercion and force, and we are only as free as the things we are allowed and able to do.

***Cooperation*** means "to act together to achieve a common benefit".

The Latin ***cooperari*** mean "to work together".










***Solidarity*** is a unity among people who know that they share common interests.

<!-- How does solidarity arise from consent and cooperation?  It feels like a medium which is sometimes, but not always, present. -->




















A ***process*** is a doing, or an action. All things can be understood in terms of what they do to other things. I write these words, hoping to explain my philosophy, and you read them, hoping to understand my motivations for my work. The words I use connect to ideas and memories in each of our minds. They are encoded as electrical charges and carried over wires. The earth was dug up and those wires were laid there by other humans, who carried out their jobs within their roles in an organisation. In doing their jobs, they earned money, which they can spend in exchange for other things. Humans, words, electricity, wires, the earth, roles, organisations, and money, participate in and enable certain processes. ....

<!-- Why is it important? -->

This way of looking at reality comes from Levi Bryant's machine-oriented ontology.

<!-- Write a separate article to explain MOO in simpler language, summarise here, and link out. -->

***Cooperation*** means "to work together".

cooperation
to work together
action, doing
doing something with other people
from a process perspective, cooperation is "doing something with other things"

<!-- Cooperation is too close to MOO and processes. How do I fuse these together and explain them at the same time? -->

***Consensus*** means "to agree together". *Consensus* builds on *consent*, and emphasises discussion: by talking with other people, we can understand each other's needs, we can find shared goals, and we can *coordinate* our actions.

*Consensus* comes from the Latin ***consentire***, which literally means "to feel together". *Consentire* deepens consensus, by bringing in emotions and experiences as other things that we must share.

*Consentire* is also the origin of ...

***Reciprocity*** means "to move backward and forward".

***Mutuality***

***Solidarity***
