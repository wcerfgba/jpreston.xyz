title: Abolish Money
---

I have been intending to write an article for a while now addressing the necessity of money in the functioning of our modern world. Unfortunately I am a perpetual non-finisher of projects, so in order to get *something* of substance out to the world, I would like to present some of my thoughts around this idea. The following is not the well-referenced, thorough piece of academic literature I had originally set out to author, but I do believe it is better to publish something than nothing.

I have started to consider that money is not necessary for our society to function, and in fact there are benefits that could come by 'abolishing' money. To illustrate this, first we need to consider what 'money' is, and what functions it serves.

To begin, I define money as any form of commodity or fiat currency, in physical form or recorded electronically. This definition of money therefore includes coins and notes issued by any reputable central bank, balances in bank accounts which correspond to such currencies, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and commodities such as gold, silver, diamonds, etc. where such commodities are used as payment in transactions.

We usually ascribe four functions to things which we call money [1] and conversely, any thing which can serve all of these functions could probably be considered as a (commodity) money, hence money is at least partly defined by its observed use in the real world. The traditional four functions are:
* a medium of exchange -- is this thing conveniently traded with people whom I need to pay?
* a measure of value -- how much do things cost, or how much are they worth?
* a standard of deferred payment -- are my creditors willing to accept it as payment?
* a store of value -- can I hold on to it in faith that at a later date it will still be able to serve an equivalent function as it could today?

The lines between some of these functions can get a bit blurry, as it is hard to imagine an entity which could be a medium of exchange but not a standard of deferred payment, and the 'value' in "store of value" is predicated on the ability of the hypothetical money-object to provide the other functions. Nonetheless, these four functions have stood the test of time in helping us elucidate what is and is not money.

These functions seem fundamental to the functioning of an economy, so how can I possibly say that we should abolish money? The key lies in an analysis of the context around and assumptions behind these functions, particularly the notion of 'exchange' or 'payment', and the notion of 'value'.

Quid pro quo exchange is heavily ingrained into our modern economic behaviour. Why would any person or company provide goods or services to a stranger without securing some form of compensation in the process? Any material that can be traded -- time, food, steel, ... -- exists in finite quantity, and any person or business that wants to survive has a list of needs that must be constantly satisfied -- I need shelter, food, water, and TV shows; my company needs my time, computers, and so on. In order to secure access to the things we need, we use money as an intermediary, because it is very probable that when we sell a good or service to someone, they will not have something that exactly fits the specification of what we need, and we may not need it at that time. Money is therefore both convenient and efficient, in that it allows its users to satisfy their needs at the most opportune time with the most suitable commodities available in the market.

However, money is not required to provide agents with access to a market in this way. Agents do not want money itself, instead they want what money embodies, which is security of access to future goods and services. We only require the exchange of money as part of a transaction because we know that it will be required as part of future transactions. A single agent in an economy could not willingly start trading goods or services without repayment in the form of money and hope to survive for long, because no other agents would be willing to provide them with *their* goods and services without receiving money in exchange. In contrast, if you take a group of agents and remove money from the entire network, then nothing about the economy has to change: people and companies can still exchange goods and services between each other in knowledge
