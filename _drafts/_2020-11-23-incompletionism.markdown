hm it depends on each project: some stuff i have no interest in or need for any more and i don't really care, but i'm glad the files are still there to remind me about that time of my life (well, a weekend heh); others i do feel a bit sad that they haven't been worked on, but having the files there means i can pick em up if i want to, and i just try to not beat myself up about being an incompletionist any more: i'm someone who just forgets about stuff and has fleeting interests, and i've tried to change that in the past and failed, so i should just embrace it and be happy with the process of each thing while it has my attention, and get satisfaction from the few things i do manage to finish

that's probably a great story to write, but now i will probably not complete it! :DDD
