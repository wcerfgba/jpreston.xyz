title: Investigation of Claims in "TRANSGENDER DEBATE: Crowder Argues Science vs. Julie Rei Goldstein | Louder With Crowder"
---

The following is an analysis of the claims made and references provided in the video "TRANSGENDER DEBATE: Crowder Argues Science vs. Julie Rei Goldstein | Louder With Crowder" [1].

### Minute-by-minute

#### 2:44 - 3:37

> Goldstein: There's actually studies which so that over 80% remain orgasmic post-surgery.

> Crowder: 100% of [cis] men experience orgasm. [C1] [...] Those who transition, it's as low as 65%. [C2]

[C1] "National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior" <https://nationalsexstudy.indiana.edu/> \
[C2] "Sexual and Physical Health After Sex Reassignment Surgery", Griet De Cuypere, Guy T’Sjoen, Ruth Beerten, et al. <https://sci-hub.tf/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-005-7926-5>

The NSSHB website [C1] is very thin, containnig only a few bullet points on the Key Facts page. There are a number of publications listed originating from the project but I could not find any which looked directly relevant to Crowder's claim. If Crowder's claim originates from one of the papers, Crowder should have cited the paper directly -- linking only to the project site is lazy at best, pureposeful indirection at worst. According to one article I have found [J1]:

> The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, states that only 25% of men routinely achieve orgasm in all sexual encounters. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, the prevalence remains constant until age 50 years and then the rate steadily increases with men in their 80s complaining twice as much as men less than age 59 years.

[J1] "Delayed orgasm and anorgasmia",     Lawrence C. Jenkins, John P. Mulhall <https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(15)01957-3/fulltext>

Crowder's claim about post-transition orgasm results also do not hold. From the paper [C2]:

> Seventy-eight percent of the total group was able to reach an orgasm through masturbation. No significant difference was found between female-to-males and male-to-females regarding the ability to reach orgasm during sexual activity with their partner,

It appears that Crowder is specifically citing from Table IV for the statistic "Orgasm during masturbation, (almost) always" specifically for MTF trans persons, which is given as 65.2% after SRS with no statistic for before SRS. This is contrasted with a 94.7% value for FTM trans persons. Additionally, Table II describes an change of "Frequency orgasm in sexual intercourse, (almost) always" from 41.7% to 50% for MTF and 45.5% to 77.8% for FTM persons, indicating that _SRS tends to aid transgender people with achieving orgasm_.

It is also important to remark that Crowder is not comparing like-for-like statistics here: one statistic is about cis people, the other is about trans people, so it is expected that there would be a difference because on the relationship members of each of these groups have with their bodies. It is more useful to consider cis rates to pre-operative trans rates, and then pre-operative trans rates to post-operative trans rates, to determine if surgery can improve the outcomes for trans people, which Crowder's paper [C2] indicates is the case.

#### 6:15 - 6:36

Goldstein begins to describe one of her own orgasmic experiences pre-surgery and Crowder puts her down because he is "uncomfortable with this territory" and because it is "anecdotal":

> Crowder: I don't necessarily know that [this] helps the people watching right now.

If Crowder is uncomfortable discussing trans people's orgasms maybe he shouldn't have brought it up for discussion in the first place. Further, as a subjective qualitative experience, aside from EEG or nerve data, any report about an orgasm is inherently anecdotal and the study that Crowder himself cited [C2] was based on a survey of trans people i.e. a statistical analysis of anecdotal evidence.

#### 9:02 - 11:14

> Crowder: The Belgian study [C3], I think it was 107 people who participated, 43% of them dropped out meaning we have no idea what happened to them by the end. We have no idea if they're still alive. So 43% of people who started the study were not included at the end, [...] that distorts the number quite a bit.

> Crowder: The Canadian study [C4] covers one year, it asks people within the last year of their surgery if they've attempted suicide.

> Crowder: When you look at those studies which objectively frame the parameters [...] it's 19 to 18 times more likely for post-operative transgenders to commit suicide across the board. [C5]

Crowder misrepresents the story of participants for the Belgian study [C3]. This was not a longitudinal study and perticipants did not "drop out" of the study, instead the authors of the study attempted to contact 107 people _as part of the initial phase of gathering subjects_:

> One hundred and seven Dutch-speaking transsexuals (63 male-to-females and 44 female-to-males) who had under-gone SRS between 1986 and 2001 were eligible for inclusion in our clinical study with a minimum postoperative delay of one year. This one-year period is often called the honey-moon period and does not present a representative picture of the long-term emotional and psychological status. Of these eligible 107 individuals, 30 persons could not be reached (28%, 22 male-to-females and eight female-to-males). Fifteen persons (14%, six male-to-females and nine female-to-males) refused to cooperate because they did not wish to be confronted with their past, six agreed to co-operate on condition they were not required to come to the clinic. The latter completed the questionnaires that were sent to them and returned them by mail. The 56 other participants (33 male-to-females and 23 female-to-males) were personally interviewed by two psychologists and examined by a surgeon and an endocrinologist.

The people who could not be reached are not counted as subjects in the rest of the paper or its statistics and so this does not affect the results of the paper. It may be interesting to consider why 28% of the _potential_ subjects were unable to be reached but we do not know and this was not the subject of the study.

No citation was provided for the Canadian study.

The control group used in the Swedish study [C5] consists of cis people:

> For each exposed person (N = 324), we randomly selected 10 unexposed controls. A person was defined as unexposed if there were no discrepancies in sex designation across the Censuses, Medical Birth, and Total Population registers and no gender identity disorder diagnosis according to the Hospital Discharge Register.

This is problematic for Crowder's framing because it means that the study is not looking at the change in suicidality or morbidity of trans people as they undergo surgery, but instead is comparing the suicidality and mortality of post-operative trans people _to people without gender dysphoria or a trans identity_. In other words, the study does not answer the question "does surgery improve the death and suicide outcomes of trans people?", instead it answers the question "are (post-operative) trans people more likely to die or commit suicide than cis people?". This is discussed in the conclusion:

> Given the nature of sex reassignment, a double blind randomized controlled study of the result after sex reassignment is not feasible. We therefore have to rely on other study designs. For the purpose of evaluating whether sex reassignment is an effective treatment for gender dysphoria, it is reasonable to compare reported gender dysphoria pre and post treatment. Such studies have been conducted either prospectively[7], [12] or retrospectively,[5], [6], [9], [22], [25], [26], [29], [38] and suggest that _sex reassignment of transsexual persons improves quality of life and gender dysphoria_. The limitation is of course that the treatment has not been assigned randomly and has not been carried out blindly.

> For the purpose of evaluating the safety of sex reassignment in terms of morbidity and mortality, however, it is reasonable to compare sex reassigned persons with matched population controls. The caveat with this design is that transsexual persons before sex reassignment might differ from healthy controls (although this bias can be statistically corrected for by adjusting for baseline differences). It is therefore important to note that the current study is only informative with respect to transsexuals persons health after sex reassignment; _no inferences can be drawn as to the effectiveness of sex reassignment as a treatment for transsexualism. In other words, the results should not be interpreted such as sex reassignment per se increases morbidity and mortality. Things might have been even worse without sex reassignment._ As an analogy, similar studies have found increased somatic morbidity, suicide rate, and overall mortality for patients treated for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.[39], [40] This is important information, but it does not follow that mood stabilizing treatment or antipsychotic treatment is the culprit.

Emphasis mine. Goldstein goes on later to make this very point.

It should also be noted that the confidence intervals on the quoted hazard ratios are quite wide: Crowder cites a 19 times higher rate of suicide but the 95% confidence intervals for adjusted ratio over the period 1973-2003 are 5.8-62.9. I am not a statistician but the potential for the estimated value to vary by an order of magnitude seems questionable to me and warrants further investigation.

#### 13:07 - 13:57

> Crowder: So what we are debating here is the idea that post-operative transgenders have improved suicidality rates. [...] It doesn't, and the overwhelming number of studies that are performed objectively using objective parameters show that it doesn't.

Unfortunately Crowder provides no citations for this claim. To contrast, I found a meta-analysis [J2] which disagrees with Crowder:

> We identified 28 eligible studies. These  studies enrolled 1833 participants with GID (1093 male-to-female, 801 female-to-male)  who underwent sex reassignment that  included hormonal therapies. All the studies were observational and most lacked controls. Pooling across studies shows that after sex reassignment, 80% of   individuals with GID reported significant   improvement in gender dysphoria (95% CI = 68–89%; 8 studies; I2 = 82%); 78% reported   significant improvement in psychological   symptoms (95% CI = 56–94%; 7 studies; I2 = 86%); 80% reported significant improvement  in quality of life  (95%  CI = 72–88%; 16  studies; I2 = 78%); and 72% reported  significant improvement in sexual function (95% CI = 60–81%; 15 studies; I2 = 78%). Very low quality evidence suggests that sex reassignment that includes hormonal  interventions in individuals with GID  likely improves gender dysphoria,  psychological functioning and comorbidities, sexual function and overall quality of life.

> Suicide attempt rates decreased after   sex reassignment but stayed higher than the  normal population rate. In one study,   although most individuals reported   improvement in their psychological status   (19/23); the remaining individuals worsened   and had increased intake of alcohol and   anxiolytics.

[J2] "Hormonal therapy and sex reassignment: a systematic review andmeta-analysis of quality of life and psychosocial outcomes", Mohammad Hassan Murad, Mohamed B. Elamin, Magaly Zumaeta Garcia, et al. <https://sci-hub.tf/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2265.2009.03625.x>

We should note that the paper indicates that many of the studies included in the meta-analysis are of low quality and that more research is needed:

> The evidence in this review is of very low quality due to the serious methodological limitations of included studies. Studies lacked bias protection   measures such as randomization and   control groups, and generally depended on  self-report to ascertain the exposure (i.e.  hormonal therapy was self-reported as  opposed to being extracted from medical  records). Our reliance on reported outcome measures may also indicate a higher risk of reporting bias within the studies. Statistical heterogeneity of the results was also significant. Furthermore, since hormonal therapies were administered as a part of sex reassignment, inferences regarding hormones solely are very weak and are confounded by the effects of sex reassignment surgery and psychotherapy, which were provided implicitly or  explicitly in most studies. Benefits noted  in individuals undergoing this transition can certainly be attributable to these two coadministered interventions. We excluded  studies that did not mention hormonal  therapies to remedy this indirectness of  evidence; this exclusion poses another   limitation to our review because it may have diminished the total body of literature. Lastly, the heterogeneity of methods, in which the outcome of satisfaction with sexual function was  assessed, may further limit  inferences about this outcome. This limitation does not apply to other outcomes such as gender dysphoria, which was assessed across studies with standardized scales.

#### 14:38 - 14:54

> Crowder: If you ask someone "Do you think your healthcare is better than the United States?" it doesn't mean it's better.

Another faulty analogy. When assessing people's subjective experiences of their own mental and physical health, sometimes you _have_ to use surveys because there are no objective measures for the variable under consideration. For example, pain scales are subjective and self-report is a key component of their use in clinical contexts. These subjective observations are very different to observing something like a healthcare system which affects many people via objectively measurable outcomes.

#### 16:25 - 16:37

> Crowder: There's also a more recent Canadian study that came from Toronto where [the rate] was 18 times more likely to commit suicide than the general population. [C6] [C7]. These are post-operative transgenders.

[C6] "Most Transgender Youth In Canada Self-Harm, Consider Suicide, Study" <https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/05/06/transgender-youth-canada-study_n_7226282.html> \
[C7] "Being Safe, Being Me" <https://apsc-saravyc.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2018/03/SARAVYC_Trans-Youth-Health-Report_EN_Final_Web2.pdf>

Considering how much Crowder rails on surveys and 'non-objective' studies in this video, I find it amusing that he is now citing a survey. The study does not discuss post-operative trans persons -- the respondents are a mixed cohort which is not broken down --, nor does it discuss the effect of surgery or other clinical interventions in improving the outcomes of trans people.

Additionally, neither the news article nor the survey itself include a statistic comparing suicidality between cis and trans populations, as Crowder claims.
