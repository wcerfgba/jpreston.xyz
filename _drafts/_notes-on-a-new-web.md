* A large number of use cases of computers today are evolutions of paper
  * Smart paper which updates, validates, calculates things
  * Ways of sending paper to other people and synchronising it
* HTML+CSS are too 'free', leading to inconsistent user interfaces and rendering engine complexity
* We need a new system which

  * accessible
  * fault-tolerant
  * ...
  * solutions for 'paper problems'
  * with consistent UI
* Should be interoperable with existing Web technologies and standards
  * to ensure adoption and use
