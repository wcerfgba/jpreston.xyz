### rachel phipps' potato hash

2 large potatoes, unpeeled, cut into bite-sized chunks
½ tsp dried chilli flakes
1 tsp olive oil
1 large yellow pepper, deseeded and thickly sliced
1 red onion, cut into thin wedges
125g/4½oz cherry tomatoes, halved
40g/1½oz curly kale, thinly sliced
4 large free-range eggs
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
Method
Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.

Toss the potatoes with the chilli flakes, oil and a generous amount of salt and pepper on baking tray. Roast for 20 minutes.

Remove the tray from the oven and toss the pepper, onion and tomatoes with the potatoes. Return to the oven for 15 minutes.

Put the kale in a bowl with a large pinch of salt. Massage the kale between your fingertips until it becomes soft and damp.

Toss the kale with the potato mixture and create four wells in the mixture. Crack an egg into each well and return the tray to the oven for 4–5 minutes, or until the egg whites are just set but the yolks are still runny.




## seitan

Mix the flour with water, work the dough with your hands, forming it into a ball. Wrap the ball into the cooking sheet and leave it to rest for 30 minutes. Unwrap the dough ball and put it in a big bowl. Pour on some cold water, so the dough ball will be completely covered. Start washing the dough ball in cold water. Wash it like you wash your socks in a sink :D Rub it together and work it hard :) You can see the water getting more white, that is the starch you want to get rid of. Wash the ball for a couple of minutes and then drain the water and pour in new water. Wash it again for a couple of minutes and then repeat the procedure for the third time. So almost all of the starch will be gone and you are left with a rubbery wheat gluten as known as seitan. In the end, you can also wash it in a running water for a minute or two. Now you have seitan. I usually cut it into strips or cubes (depends on the meal I want to make), boil them (until they float on top), drain and fry or marinate before cooking.

##  Jacques Pepin Corn Parfait

A parfait is a smooth cream dessert, and this savory recipe is creamy and smooth as well, hence the name. Corn dishes are always best in full corn season, with the ears picked fresh from the garden. Yet, supermarkets generally have pretty good corn most of the year, and this recipe is a great addition to roast meat or grilled fish, as well as being a good first course for dinner or main course for lunch. This parfait is always better when slightly wet and undercooked in the center.

Yield: 4 servings

Ingredients:

1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese
1 1/2 cups half and half
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon unsalted butter, softened
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
4 ears corn, husked
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Directions:

Coat a 4 or 5 cup gratin dish with the butter. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Cut the kernels off the ears of corn, and put them in the bowl of a food processor with the flour, eggs, salt, and pepper. Process until well pureed. Add the half and half, and process for another 5 to 10 seconds. Pour into the buttered dish, and sprinkle the Parmesan cheese on top.

Bake for about 25 minutes (mine took about 40 minutes) or until just set, puffy, and nicely browned. Serve. (The parfait is best served immediately, but you can make it 1 to 2 hours ahead and reheat it in the oven or microwave.)
