need to look at DALYs as well as QALYs!
  actually its a deeper issue with utility values and functions...


this is also connecting with things like money abolition, community organising, my PhD, participatory democracy... it's about understanding how the methods used shape the responses from people and the validity of the results, among other things ...



for the 'slideshow', i can create some slides as images or web pages and just open all in tabs and then nav through them!



## Content warning

Before we begin, I have to give you a content warning. This presentation deals with economics, neoliberalism, health, and ableism. You may find some of these topics boring and/or distressing. Feel free to leave at any time.

## Headlines

OK so today I want to talk to you about health economics, and specifically about how health is valued and monetised in our society. In other words, how do people come up with claims like the following:

<iframe src="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14502499"></iframe>

"Cutting salt 'should be global priority'", a BBC article from 2011. They cover a report whose authors "point to the US, where cutting salt intake by a third would save tens of thousands of lives and save up to $24 billion annually in health care costs".

<iframe src="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-30122015"></iframe>

Here we have a 2014 BBC article, "Obesity 'costing same as smoking'". "The McKinsey Global Institute said it cost £1.3tn, or 2.8% of annual economic activity - it cost the UK £47bn."

<iframe src="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37451773"></iframe>

2016, "Illnesses associated with lifestyle cost the NHS £11bn".

<iframe src="https://www.nesta.org.uk/feature/counting-the-cost-of-obesity-in-scotland/"></iframe>

And one more, this time from 2023, a report from Nesta on "Counting the cost of obesity in Scotland", which claims that "The annual cost of obesity in Scotland in 2022 was £5.3bn".

Scary numbers, right? In each case we're talking about billions of pounds, and notice how this economic cost is always included: it's not just about people's lives, it's also about money.

## Value of a life

What's happening here is human lives -- that's my life, and your life -- have an economic value, they're worth a certain amount of money. And health economists have different tools they use to figure out exactly how much each human life is worth.

## QALYs

...

QALYs are the most common tool for valuing health, at least in the UK. Would you like to know how much the Department of Health and Social Care has decided one year of perfect health is worth?

<iframe src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1063330/Green_Book_2022.pdf#page=96"></iframe>

It's documented here, in the Green Book, the UK Central Government advice on appraisal and evaluation, on page 87. "The current monetary [willingness-to-pay] value for a QALY is £70,000 in 20/21 prices." Unfortunately if you want to know _how_ they've arrived at that figure, you need to write to the Department of Health and Social Care. As of Friday 4th August 2023, I'm currently waiting to find out.

## Willingness-to-pay

## DALYs

## Utility theory

The key thing about QALYs and DALYs is that they are _adjusted_, which means they're not just a measure of how long your life is in a specific 'health state', but they multiply that time by a utility value, to allow economists to compare different health states.

## EQ-5D

There are a few ways to calculate these utility values or weights, and a particularly common one is using a survey called the EQ-5D. It's developed by the EuroQol Research Foundation, and it's a set of 6 questions.

<iframe src="file:///home/jpreston/Downloads/Sample_UK-English-EQ-5D-5L-Paper-Self-Complete-v1.2-ID-24700.pdf"></iframe>

All it does is ask you to rate how you're doing today on a scale of 1 to 5, in terms of walking about, washing and dressing yourself, doing your usual activities, if you have any pain or discomfort, and if your anxious or depressed. It also asks you to imagine the best and worst health possible and to rank yourself today on a scale between those extremes.

You might note that this assumes that you can walk, and if you're in a wheelchair or use another mobility aid it doesn't distinguish between your ability and how enabling the world around you is; it doesn't ask about if you're able to feed yourself, or if you have an appetite, or if you can keep food down; it doesn't ask about your relationships, if you feel safe or if you feel cared for. There are loads of things it doesn't ask you.

Instead it asks you about a few important, but vague, things, and asks you to rate them as 'slight' or 'moderate' or 'severe'. And then it asks you this bizarre hypothetical about the best and worst health you can imagine.
