Eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce.

* 1 onion, diced or sliced
* passata or chopped tomatoes in sauce
* 1 small carrot, grated
* 1 small pepper, diced
* 4 eggs
* salt, paprika, cumin, and cayenne to season

Onion can be fried in olive oil before adding tomatoes, or onion can be added after.

Reduce tomatoes with a little oil. Add pepper, carrot and other vegetables (onion if not pre-fried), and seasoning, and simmer for a few minutes. Make small wells in the sauce to poach the eggs. Serve when happy with eggs, approx. 8 minutes.
