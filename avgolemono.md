A [[recipe]], originally from Victoria Granof at Epicurious [^1].

* 2 cups broth
* 2/3 cup uncooked orzo (or rice or pastina) [^2]
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 2 eggs
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice

1. In a large saucepan, bring the broth to a boil.
2. Add the orzo, rice, or pastina and cook until tender but still al dente, about 7 minutes (20, if using rice). Season with the salt and pepper and reduce heat to a low simmer.
3. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and lemon juice until smooth.
4. Temper the eggs by ladling about 1 cup of the hot broth into the egg-and-lemon mixture, then whisk to combine.
5. Add the mixture back to the simmering saucepan. Stir just until the soup becomes opaque and thickens as the eggs cook, 1 to 2 minutes. Season and serve.

Tastes better cold!

Ideas:
* add diced onion or garlic
* add lemon zest to really kick up the flavour
* a bit of diced or sliced carrot
* dill

[^2]: Traditionally this is a soup, and has chicken added to it. There is only supposed to be a bit of orzo, but I bulk up the carbs instead of substituting the chicken. You could add tofu, not sure what else to use.
