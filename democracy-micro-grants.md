Democracy only thrives when there is wide participation and engagement in it. However, people are not incentivised to engage in processes which may be complicated and require emotional and mental labour. Further, the lack of monetary compensation creates structural barriers for many people, particularly minoritised people. An organisation should exist to which people can apply for individual funding to participate in democracy, be that travelling to sit in a council meeting, or submit evidence to a committee.
