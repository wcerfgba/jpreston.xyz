Welcome to my first [[digest]]. In this article I will be sharing some of the best blog posts, journal articles, podcasts, books, and videos I've discovered in the last few months.

**Parker, Simon. ‘Conservative Anarchism, Self-Organisation and the Future of Government’. Medium (blog), 22 June 2020. <https://medium.com/@SimonFParker/conservative-anarchism-self-organisation-and-the-future-of-government-2ef5447b7f02>.**

Simon Parker is a civil servant in the UK working for Redbridge Council in London. I found this article by web-searching for '"systems thinking" conservatism', as I was curious to see if anyone had examined how systems thinking can fit into a conservative political-philosophical mindset. Simon's article doesn't look at this, but I am very glad I found it because it has been one of the most interesting and exciting articles I've read all year. Like a good brownie, this article is dense but not overwhelming: it's chock full of insights but still manages to be readable over a cup of tea. At the end Simon remarks that they were "going to write a book, but decided to splurge the ideas down as a short essay instead", and I would love to see some of these ideas developed further.

In this article, Simon discusses the origins and failure of New Public Management; the application of agile development, design thinking, and systems thinking to policy-making; and self-organisation as an end goal for the next evolution of democracy. To illustrate these ideas, Simon comments on recent political elections in the UK and USA; previous governments in the UK; US-Mexico border legislation; the effect of austerity on local government budgets; housing policy and the competing interests at play in the housing system; Occupy, Enspiral, and the Sunflower Movement; and Brexit, Trump, and Extinction Rebellion.

Overall, this is a very insightful read for anyone interested in public policy, democracy, and/or organisation design.

**boyd, danah. ‘Statistical Imaginaries’. Substack newsletter. Data: Made Not Found (by danah) (blog), 1 December 2021. <https://zephoria.substack.com/p/statistical-imaginaries>.**

In this talk (available as a transcript or a video of a presentation danah gave at the Microsoft Research Summit 2021, linked via the post), danah boyd explains the inherently political nature of data, and census data in particular. Various aspects of data and its politicisation are discussed, and there are two issues which stand out to me. First, the way that uncertainty is indicated and communicated to policy-makers and the public affects the perception of data and statistics as authoritative and accurate, with scientists and statisticians having to make trade-offs between scientific honesty and the appearance of correctness. Second, the choice of sampling methods
