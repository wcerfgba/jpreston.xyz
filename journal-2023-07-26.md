hypertext document system
using yaml to define configurations and data
written in php for portability

a document is a yaml file.

a document type is a document which defines the structure of fields across a set of documents.

a template is a document which can be used to render a document into another file format.

1. write a document type which defines document types. call this 'dtdt' for document type document type.
2. write a template which transforms a document type into a HTML form for constructing that document type.
3. render the document type as a HTML form.
4. write a php script which can receive a POSTed document and store it as a file.
5. serve the document type HTML form

this provides a self-editing system to provide data entry, data definition, and presentation. here's how you can build:

a blog:

6. create a document type for a blog post via the document type HTML form. it could have title and body keys.
7. create a template to render a blog post document into a Markdown document.
8. edit the blog post document type to set a command to run on save. make it render the blog post to markdown, and then convert from markdown to HTML and place in the same directory.
9. render the blog post document type as a HTML form.

or, a events listing site:
