I store most of my links in my Zotero library at <https://www.zotero.org/wcerfgba/library>. This is where you can find papers, articles, podcasts, and other resources I stumble across. I rely on my own set of tags to organise my collection, but I still collect the automatic tags. I recommend hiding the automatic tags to help you navigate my collection. Previously I made use of folders/sub-collections but I find tags are more flexible.

I keep a list of most TV and movies I want to watch in an IMDB watchlist at <https://www.imdb.com/user/ur129942593/watchlist>. Usually I keep things in there if I want to watch them again, even if I've already seen them a few times.

In addition to posting my music on this site I also upload it to SoundCloud at <https://soundcloud.com/wcerfgba>. You can find some of my collaborations with other people there too.

My partner is Alwyn Carroll and you can find his website at <https://alwyn.neocities.org/>.

Here are links to some of my friends' websites:
