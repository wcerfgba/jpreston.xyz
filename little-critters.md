This is an idea for a game inspired by simulation games and language. The player is able to move freely around a map populated by various 'critters', social animals who communicate with a randomly generated language. Gameplay consists of the player observing the critters going about their activities and trying to learn the syntax and vocabulary of the language so that they can communicate with the critters and achieve some objective.
