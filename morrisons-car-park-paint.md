These are [[photograph]]s of a strip of paint separating two car parking spaces in a Morrisons car park in North West England, taken in June 2019. The car park has since been re-tarmac'ed and re-painted, and so these photographs may serve as the only record of the prior state of this paintwork. Over the years, the paint had cracked and discoloured due to exposure from the sun and rain, and the tyres of many hundreds if not thousands of vehicles.
