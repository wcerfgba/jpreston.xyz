  This is a website I built for some friends up in Glasgow who run a canal boat trip co-operative. The design is skeuomorphic and makes heavy use of existing design assets and branding. It's a mostly static site made with [Harp](http://harpjs.com/) and a sprinkle of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for the booking form. On the backend, there are a couple of PHP scripts and a cron job for receiving booking requests, and sending confirmation emails.
