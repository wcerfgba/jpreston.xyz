A very simple, very easy bread recipe which has an extremely crispy crust and bubbly crumpet like inner. The dough mix is very loose, you may feel like there is too much water but I urge you to try this first and then adjust to your preference.

* 3 cups flour
* 1 tspn salt
* 0.5 tspn yeast
* 1.5 cups lukewarm water (loose mix)

Combine dry ingredients. Mix in water. Cover and ferment somewhere warm for 18-24 hrs. Pour dough blob onto a floured surface and shape into a ball -- some extra flour on outside to help you handle it is OK. Grease and flour a dutch oven or baking dish. Proof in dish for 90 mins. Bake covered for 30 mins at 220 C. Remove cover, bake for 20 mins or until sufficiently crisp.
