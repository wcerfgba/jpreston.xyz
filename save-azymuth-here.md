Often I am out walking and I see a good scene I would like to photograph, but I don't have my DSLR. I would like an app on my phone which will take a photo, and will use the geotag and datetime information to infer the solar azimuth and zenith angles and provide a calendar of other datetimes when the sun will be in the same or a similar position. This would allow me to schedule a time to go back and take the photograph I want with my DSLR.
