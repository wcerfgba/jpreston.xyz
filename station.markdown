midnight drunken ramble, \
car park vacant, cold. \
head to platform's shelter, \
electric eyes behold.

merry shadows tumble, \
dance on black tarmac, \
cast from phosphor lights of \
transient abodes.

hashish to break and crumble, \
guard from wind and rain. \
lit with spark√®d flame, the \
joint is handed round.

steel stallions rumble \
over metal veins, \
fed on oil and lightning, \
galloping in to night.
