Back in July 2019 I had the idea of starting a newsletter in my town to connect a different groups together and raise awareness of what's going on, since I kept hearing about random cool stuff like the [Accordion Club](http://www.accordionclub.co.uk/), [Leyland Artists](http://www.leylandartists.co.uk/), [Radio Leyland](https://www.radioleyland.co.uk/), and the Syrian Bistro.

It's a simple self-contained HTML page (except for images) which is designed to be printable as a double-sided A5 flyer, or viewable as a Web page on desktop and mobile.

This quickly led to the [Radio Leyland What's On](/radio-leyland-whats-on) page
